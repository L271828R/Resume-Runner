# Resume Runner

When you are actively looking for work you have many versions
of your resume. Each with different tweeks:

On some you have Java, on other Python on other you have AI.

When you are looking for wrok actively you may have head hunters
who are helping you. They have versions of your resume that
they are looking at. They do not want to send not reputable
prospects to see thier clients.

In essence, actively looking for work. That is applying to 10 jobs
a day is a document management nightmare.

And worse when you get a company that wants to interview a few 
weeks later. You have no idea what resume you sent not what
position you are interviewing for.
